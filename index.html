				<h2><u>Interest in IT</u></h2><br/><br/>
				<p>IT is a huge field which is always changing. There are many pathways we can choose for our future job. My favourite field in IT is Web Developing. My interest in IT started from grade 10. I did Information Technology as a subject for my Ordinary Level. So At that time I refer many web sites and tried to find the coding behind those web sites. My uncle is a Web developer so most of the time I ask questions from him and try to learn about Web Developing because of my interest. Till now I got some experience in IT field such as I did Information Technology as a subject for my ordinary level and I finished a project about programming calculator with C language.</p><br/>
				<p>RMIT is a well known university which has many experts for their stuff for teaching. Also as a international student I like to study with many other international students like me. So RMIT is the second largest university which has most international students. Another reason is that RMIT is situated  in Melbourne City. It helps me to go lectures easily with public transport. Information technology is a practical subject so I looked a university which offers good and best practical sessions and facilities. I found that RMIT is one of the best universe sites which provide top class practices facilities for their students. So it made me to choose RMIT for my university.</p></br>

<p>In this degree I would like to study about basic knowledge of information technology and also I aspect to study about programming quite more. My ambition is to be a web developer so I want to do web developing as a major for my degree. I need to read tech books written about web developing as much as I can to improve my knowledge. I like to learn from Hang out with people who are smarter than me. I think it is a good way to improve our knowledge.</p>

			<p>According to these three tests I think I am a tactile learner and I am a person who like to listen others ideas as well as mine. Also the results are showing that I am more comfortable with familiar surroundings and don’t like to work with new things. But I think I got the self motivation and communication skills fair enough.</p></br></br>
			
			<p>I think this results may be effect me when I am with a team to do some group work. Uncomfortable with new things is a big disadvantage for me to work with a team. Again my Auditory learning skill also weak so it will also effect me when I am going to deal with my team members to find information. The scores showing that I got some skills to listen other people’s ideas. I think it would be helpful me to work with a team.</p></br></br>
			
			<h2><u>Project Ideas</u></h2></br></br>
			<p>I like to develop a mobile phone application for my project. I choose to develop video player application for mobile phones. With this app the user can player many video formats such as MP4, AVI, MKV, FLV, MOV, and 3GP. I need to develop a grate UI for this player which helps the user to do their tasks easily and fast. I am planning to add a internal web browser with a downloader to download any video that user wants to download. So I need to add a file manager feature to sort the downloaded files.</p></br></br>
			
			<p>Before thinking about this project idea I searched Google play store for a good video player with integrated downloader but I didn’t find a good app. These days people are using their smart phone to watch video online and offline quite often. But there aren’t any app which is satisfying user’s every needs. That’s why I think about this kind of project as my project idea. 
			</p></br></br>
			
			</p>For this project I am planning to build a good user interface with three tabs which are for the video player, Downloaded files and integrated web browser. I need to add preferences inside the app to change settings when it needs. Supporting every video formats is a different task to achieve so that I need to create proper error massages when the player can’t open some video formats. In the downloaded files tab I have to create a proper file manager interface which can be sorting files and giving details about files such as downloaded time, file name, file size and ect. 

These are the file formats I am planning to develop for this application - MP4, MOV, FLV, VOB, WMV, MPEG and 3GP.</p>
